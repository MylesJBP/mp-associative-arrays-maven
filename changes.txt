The comments for my initial submission of MP4 were as follows:

1. You have 40 checkstyle errors. I recommend just going through your checkstyle errors and fixing them.
Sam provided a checker for this.

I fixed this issue by simply going through the mvn checkstyle:check checkstyle errors and fixing all 40 of them.

2. A significant amount of JUnit tests failed. The main problem seems to be
that the java heap space was filled up too much, which caused java to freak out.
Check on your methods again, and try to fix anywhere where excess space is being allocated.

I realized that the issue was the I was expanding my array after I set any element in my "set" method
and my "clone" method, causing an overflow of allocated space. Therefore, I added try/catch statements
in each of those methods so that it will try to add the element to the array, than only expand the size of it if
that doesn't work because enough space hasn't already been allocated. To my knowledge, this fixed the issue given
that it allowed all of the JUnit tests to run and pass.

3. The toString method seems not to work.

I realized that I was not adding ", " after each kay/value pair in my AA, which made my toString
output incorrect, so I added an if statement that added that after every pair except the last one.
This fixed the issue.

Additional Things I added:

I added an extra experiment in AAExperiments.java to test my toString method and subsequently
added my name to the top of the file.
